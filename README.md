# Custom-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-Spam-Message-Classification

This project in Python uses a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify spam messages. The majority of the code was created to make a custom Naive Bayes Classifier. At the end of the file, a comparison was made to the scikit-learn MultinomialNB classifier to compare performances. 

Several techniques were used to construct this classifier:
- Duplicate removal
- Custom out-of-bag vectorization of vocabulary
- Building classifier algorithm
- Calculating parameters using pandas techniques
- Creating training and test datasets
